plumber 0.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add a filter which parses and sets req$cookies to be a list corresponding to
  the cookies provided with the request.
* Responses can set multiple cookies
* Bug Fix: conver non-character arguments in setCookie to character before URL-
  encoding.

plumber 0.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Set options(warn=1) during execution of user code so that warnings are 
  immediately visible in the console, rather than storing them until the server
  is stopped.

plumber 0.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add `sessionCookie` function to define a processor that can be used as a
  globalProcessor on a router to encrypt values from req$session and store them
  as an encrypted cookie in on the user's browser.
* Added `setCookie` method to response which (primitively) allows you to set
  a cookie to be included in the response.
* Add `addGlobalProcessor` method on `plumber` class to support a processor that
  runs a processor only a single time, before and then after all other filters 
  and the endpoint.
* Document all public params so CHECK passes
